This repository presents a robust implementation of topic modeling, a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP) and text mining, using the fastAPI framework. Topic modeling is a method for discovering abstract topics within a collection of documents by analyzing the patterns of word occurrences and co-occurrences. The repository leverages the fastAPI framework to create a RESTful API that exposes the topic modeling functionality, allowing users to seamlessly integrate it into their applications or workflows.
The core of this project revolves around the implementation of popular topic modeling algorithms, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). These algorithms are capable of automatically extracting meaningful topics from large corpora of unstructured text data, enabling efficient exploration, organization, and summarization of textual information.
With the fastAPI-based API, users can easily interact with the topic modeling functionality by sending requests with their text data and receiving topic distributions, keyword lists, and other relevant information in a standardized format. This repository aims to simplify the integration of topic modeling capabilities into various applications, such as document clustering, information retrieval, recommendation systems, and text analytics pipelines.
